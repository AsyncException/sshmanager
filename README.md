# SSH Manager

## Overview
This is a simple SSH manager program designed to make it easier to connect to multiple servers without the hassle of remembering server addresses, usernames, and passwords. The program allows users to save server configurations along with optional passwords for quick and easy access.

## Features
- **Save Servers**: Users can save server configurations including server address and port.
- **Save Users**: For each saved server, users can save their username and optionally a password for authentication.
- **Easy Connection**: Once servers and user credentials are saved, users can quickly connect to servers without needing to remember details.

## Warning
**Important Note**: The passwords provided for server authentication are currently stored in plain text format in the database. Therefore, it's crucial not to reuse passwords that are used within this application for other purposes. Users are advised to exercise caution when using this feature and consider the security implications of storing passwords in plain text.

## Usage
To use the SSH manager:

1. Run the installer.exe from the latest release to install the latest version of the application.
2. Once the installation is complete, access the tool by opening a terminal or command prompt.
3. Type 'sshmanager' in the terminal or command prompt to launch the SSH manager.
